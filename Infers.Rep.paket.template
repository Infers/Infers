description
        Infers.Rep provides rules for Infers to generate representations and
        efficient accessors for F# types based on a sum of products
        representation.  The representations are designed to allow the
        implementation of efficient polytypic and datatype generic functions.
releaseNotes
        This is an experimental version of Infers.Rep and is not recommended for
        production use.
