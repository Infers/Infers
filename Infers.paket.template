description
        Infers is a library for deriving F# values from their types and, in a way, a direct application of the Curry-Howard correspondence.  The idea is to view the types of F# member functions as Horn clauses.  Using a Prolog-style resolution engine it is then possible to attempt to prove goals given as simple F# types.  During the resolution process the engine invokes the member functions to build a value of the type given as the goal.
