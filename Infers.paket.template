description
        Infers is a library for deriving F# values from their types and, in a
        way, a direct application of the Curry-Howard correspondence.  The idea
        is to view the types of F# member functions as Horn clauses.  Using a
        Prolog-style resolution engine it is then possible to attempt to prove
        goals given as simple F# types.  During the resolution process the
        engine invokes the member functions to build a value of the type given
        as the goal.
releaseNotes
        This is an experimental version of Infers and is not recommended for
        production use.
